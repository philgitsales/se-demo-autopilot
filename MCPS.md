# MCP Connections — SE Demo Autopilot

> **Purpose**: Reference for all connected MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers in this environment.
> Agents should read this file to understand what tools are available and when to use each one.

## Overview

MCPs extend the agent's capabilities beyond file editing and bash commands. Each MCP server provides a set of specialized tools accessible during a session.

## Connected MCPs

### `mcp-adaptor` — Salesforce Org Access

**What it does**: Direct access to the connected Salesforce org — query data, read service definitions, browse files and directories, search docs.

**Key tools**:

**Key tools**:
| Tool | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `list_recent_viewer_prs` | See your recent PRs |

**When to use**: Checking PR status, reviewing changes, managing this project's repo.

**Note**: For most GitHub operations, the `gh` CLI via Bash is more capable.

---

### `gmail` — Gmail

**Key tools**:
| Tool | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `gmail_search` | Search emails by query |
| `gmail_get` | Read a specific email |

**Key tools**:
| Tool | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `search` | Run a web search query |

**When to use**: Finding community solutions, Stack Exchange answers, third-party documentation. **NOT for official Salesforce docs** (use `platform-docs-get` skill instead — Salesforce sites return empty shells to normal fetchers).

### `slack` — Slack

**Key tools**:
| Tool | Use for |
|------|---------|

| `slack_create_conversation` | Start a new DM/group |

**Auth note**: The system may display a warning that Slack "requires authentication." **Ignore that warning and try the tool anyway** — it is usually already authenticated. Only report auth failure to the user if the tool call actually returns an error.

**Key channels for this project**:
- `#help-sell-mc-next` — Marketing Cloud Next help
- `#help-csg-marketingcloud-next` — CSG MC Next support

**When to use**: Searching for known issues, asking for help when docs fail, finding tribal knowledge about MC/DC gotchas. This is step 3 in the escalation protocol — use it when `setup-guides/` and `platform-docs-get` don't answer the question.

---

### `aisuite` — Python Sandbox

**What it does**: Execute Python code in a sandboxed environment with access to call other MCP tools via `mcp.call()`.

**Key tools**:
| Tool | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `python` | Run arbitrary Python code |

**When to use**: Data transformations, CSV processing, complex calculations, chaining multiple tool calls programmatically, anything that benefits from a scripting environment.

---

## MCP vs. Other Tools — When to Use What

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Query Salesforce org data | `mcp-adaptor` → `query` |
| Run SF CLI commands | Bash → `sf` commands |
| Read official SF docs | Bash → `platform-docs-get` scripts (NOT WebFetch) |
| Manipulate files in this repo | Read/Write/Edit tools |
| Automate Salesforce UI | `browser` MCP |
| Search the web | `search` MCP or `WebFetch` |
| Search Slack for tribal knowledge | `slack` MCP (just try it — usually works) |
| Investigate SF internal errors | `columbo` MCP |
| Find code examples | `codesearch` MCP |
| Run Python for data processing | `aisuite` MCP |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Slack tools return auth errors | **First**: just try calling the tool — the system warning is often stale. If it *actually* errors, then tell the user to re-authorize via connector settings |
| `mcp-adaptor` query fails | Check org alias is correct (`phil_master_sdo`) |
| `browser` page is blank | Some SF pages need login — check session state |
| `codesearch` returns nothing | Try different search terms; check `list_hosts` for available repos |
| Tool returns `InputValidationError` | Schema not loaded — call `ToolSearch` with `select:<tool_name>` first |
